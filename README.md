This is the SERVER code! Client code is in a different repo (to be linked here later).
All issues (for both server and client) will exist in this repo.

The webserver, running the latest stable build of this repo, will always be active. If you try and connect to it and it doesn't work, wait a few seconds and try again. The webserver may be idling, and it needs to wake up.

To run locally:
* Install node/npm
* In the root directory, run:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
* The server will run on "localhost:3000"
